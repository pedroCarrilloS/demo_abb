# This knowledge base will check connectivity issues between robot and our monitoring tool

If the monitoring tool is not storing data follow this steps:

1. Check the connection between the robot and the endpoint:

  Open a terminal at your edge machine and run
  "ping -c 1 $ROBOT_IP"
  (if the robot doesn't have ping service opened, test with "telnet $ROBOT_IP $PORT")

  If we have a response like:

    PING $ROBOT_IP ($ROBOT_IP) 56(84) bytes of data.
    64 bytes from $ROBOT_IP: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.017 ms

    --- $ROBOT_IP ping statistics ---
    1 packets transmitted, 1 received, 0% packet loss, time 0ms
    rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.017/0.017/0.017/0.000 ms

  Then we have connection from the edge machine to the robot. Continue at step 2.

  If we don't have the expected response, make sure the robot is on, and there is no issues in your company network.

2. Check if the edge machine has the ports open

   Run this command at your terminal:

   "netstat -onaput | grep $SERVICE_PORT"

   You should see the service port status as LISTEN or ESTABLISHED. Check also if the firewall rules are allowing this connection running this command:

   "iptables -L | grep $SERVICE_PORT"

   You should see something like this:

   ACCEPT     tcp  --  anywhere             172.17.0.2           tcp dpt:$SERVICE_PORT


   If you cannot see the expected output, make sure the docker is running running:

   "docker ps"

   You should see your container with the $SERVICE_PORT exposed like "0.0.0.0:$SERVICE_PORT->$SERVICE_PORT/tcp" If you miss this output, please relaunch your docker container with:

   docker-compose up

   If after one minute, the connection is not working, please contact our support team.
